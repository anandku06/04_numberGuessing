# Random Number Guessing Game

## About the Project

This is a simple **Random Number Guessing Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The primary focus of this project is to practice **DOM manipulation** skills and enhance understanding of core web development concepts.

### Features
- A randomly generated secret number.
- Input field for users to guess the number.
- Feedback messages to indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- A score counter to track the user's attempts.
- A reset button to restart the game.

### Learning Objectives
- Practicing DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
- Styling the user interface with CSS.
- Handling user inputs and events dynamically.
- Developing interactive features using vanilla JavaScript.

---

## Built With
- **HTML5**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the game interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Game logic and DOM manipulation.

2. Enter your guess in the input field and press the "Guess" button.
3. The game will provide feedback:
   - "Too High" if your guess is higher than the secret number.
   - "Too Low" if your guess is lower than the secret number.
   - "Correct!" if you guess the number.
4. Use the "Reset" button to play again.
